			<h1>Volunteering with Camp Outlook</h1>
      <p>Camp Outlook trip leaders are people from many walks of life who are respectful, open-minded, and kind. There is no experience necessary! We provide all the training, certifications, and experience for our volunteers to become qualified trip leaders. Our volunteers thrive with a desire to learn, a can-do attitude, and a strong sense of cooperation. We are motivated by a desire to share fun adventures and unique learning opportunities with our campers. People of all backgrounds, identities, and life experiences, especially marginalized and underrepresented people, are encouraged to apply.</p>

      <h2>Summer Volunteers</h2>
      <p>A typical summer for volunteers takes place from late May to the end of August, with 4-6 weeks of training and 2 months of trips. Room and board is provided, as well as training and certifications for canoeing, swimming, first aid and mental health. A summer as a volunteer with Camp Outlook will set you up for all your canoe trips in the future, and many past volunteers go on to lead many more canoe trips at other organizations.</p>

      <h2>Winter Volunteers</h2>
      <p>A typical winter for volunteers takes place in the school year, from September to April. Our winter program runs out of Queen's University in Kingston, and relies on mostly Queen's students for volunteers. We run overnight hiking trips in the fall at Frontenac Park, as well as day activities when the temperature drops. Winter Outlook is more of a club, where volunteers can help with fundraising, camper engagement, and of course going on trips and generally getting to know each other.</p>

        <h4>Abby</h4>
        <p>Our standard trip length is a 9 day trip in Algonquin Park. While the length of the trip at 9 days may seem daunting to a camper at first, being in the park together as a group allows for a challenging, yet wonderfully rewarding and enjoyable time. We often take both returning campers and first time campers on our 9 day trips, and work hard to create a positive and challenging experience for everyone, no matter where they're at.</p>

While studying forestry at the University of Toronto, he decided to try to find an opportunity to combine his love of nature with his desire to introduce others to its therapeutic value. Volunteering with Outlook as a canoe trip leader and then as a summer camp director opened up a world of possibilities to him that once seemed impossibly out of reach. Vlad is excited to help keep Outlook thriving while serving his first term on the board.</p>
