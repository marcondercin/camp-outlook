			<h1>Volunteering with Camp Outlook</h1>
      <p>Camp Outlook trip leaders are people from many walks of life who are respectful, open-minded, and kind. There is no experience necessary! We provide all the training, certifications, and experience for our volunteers to become qualified trip leaders. Our volunteers thrive with a desire to learn, a can-do attitude, and a strong sense of cooperation. We are motivated by a desire to share fun adventures and unique learning opportunities with our campers. People of all backgrounds, identities, and life experiences, especially marginalized and underrepresented people, are encouraged to apply.</p>

      <h2>Summer Volunteers</h2>
      <div class="dash"></div>
      <p>A typical summer for volunteers takes place from late May to the end of August, with 4-6 weeks of training and 2 months of trips. Room and board is provided, as well as training and certifications for canoeing, swimming, first aid and mental health. A summer as a volunteer with Camp Outlook will set you up for all your canoe trips in the future, and many past volunteers go on to lead many more canoe trips at other organizations.</p>

      <h2>Winter Volunteers</h2>
      <div class="dash"></div>
      <p>A typical winter for volunteers takes place in the school year, from September to April. Our winter program runs out of Queen's University in Kingston, and relies on mostly Queen's students for volunteers. We run overnight hiking trips in the fall at Frontenac Park, as well as day activities when the temperature drops. Winter Outlook is more of a club, where volunteers can help with fundraising, camper engagement, and of course going on trips and generally getting to know each other.</p>

        <h3>5 Day</h3>
        <p>Historically, our shortest trip was a 9 day excursion into Algonquin Park, but we understood how daunting that could be. Now, we offer 5 day trips to the much closer, and easily accessible Frontenac Provincial Park, just an hour north of our home in Kingston, ON. So if you're a new and nervous camper, have no fear. The five day is an excellent intro to the world of canoe tripping that doesn't take you too far from home.</p>

        <h3>9 Day</h3>
        <p>Our standard trip length is a 9 day trip in Algonquin Park. While the length of the trip at 9 days may seem daunting to a camper at first, being in the park together as a group allows for a challenging, yet wonderfully rewarding and enjoyable time. We often take both returning campers and first time campers on our 9 day trips, and work hard to create a positive and challenging experience for everyone, no matter where they're at.</p>

        <h3>14 Day</h3>
        <p>Our longest trip is a 14 day trip. These trips run towards the end of the summer, and require at least one previous trip with us and a recommendation from the camper's previous staff. The 14-day is an amazing and challenging experience for campers and staff alike, and really brings out the best of what the beautiful Ontario wilderness has to offer.</p>

        <h3>Specialty</h3>
        <p>Finally, we offer leadership, and internship trips for our most experienced returning campers. These trips are typically completed by campers who have already gone on a trip with us before and would like to take on a different role.</p>
