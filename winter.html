			<h1>Winter Programming</h1>
      <p>Fall and winter trips with Outlook work a little differently than summer. In the fall we go on weekend hiking trips to Frontenac Provincial Park, and camp overnight at one of the available sites. In the winter, we do fun day activities such as skating, snowshoeing, hiking and more!</p>

    <p class="top">A typical summer trip consists of a 9 day canoe trip in Algonquin Park with a maximum of 6 campers and 3 trip staff. However, we offer many different types of canoe trips, ranging in length from 5 days to 14 days, and provide extra opportunities for returning campers to take on a leadership role on a trip of their own, learning skills from firemaking and canoeing to navigating group situations and leadership.</p>

        <h3>Fall Trips</h3>
        <p>A typical fall trip is a weekend hiking trip in Frontenac Provincial Park with a range of campers and staff. We drive an hour north of Kingston to the access point, and hike in to one of many available sites. Then we set up camp, start a fire, eat tasty food and share stories. The next day, we pack up camp and hike back out to the access point, and drive back to Kingston.</p>

        <h3>Winter Activities</h3>
        <p>During the winter season, we go out on fun urban adventures throughout the city. Sometimes we'll go skating, rock climbing, or hiking for the day. We also go to local activities in the city, like a board game night at Kingston's own Minotaur, and Maple Madness at Little Cateraqui Creek Conservation Area.</p>
